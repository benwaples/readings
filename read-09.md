## Reading 09 summary

## HTML CH 7
Ugh i really needed form validation on this last lab! This chapter covers all sorts of different form inputs we can use, and when to use them. Also it is really helpful to know we can format the inputs differently so that the user knows how to format the text.

name each `input`.

## HTML CH 14
idk what `list-style: circle is`. Forms are displayed significantly different on each browser. There are tons of different ways to format and style your forms so they are easier to read and look nicer. Also, cursors can change into all sorts of different little images.


## JS CH 6
the event tool is really useful! Event delegation seems cool, doesn't make much sense but thats okay. Maybe we are already doing it? All the different events that can happen are really cool specifically `focus` and `blur`. We use functions in our event handlers, but often times we put more as well. Wonder why that is.
