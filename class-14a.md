## CSS Transforms
These were all super cool! I can see how they would be super fun to use on cards. They add a very realistic to elements on a page. I won't remember all of these, however I know exactly where to go to understand how each one of the transforms properties works! My favorites were the 3D transforms, the cube example is sickening.

## CSS Transitions and Animations
It is nice to finally see what the `keyframes` code block from the bootstrap is does. Transitions are super straight forward and easy to use, which makes me happy because it adds SO MUCH to a page. I am stoked make my buttons super cool with these.

Keyframes are wee more complicated, but all the while very useful for moving over the page. The bouncing ball example is great cause it shows how you can set a placement for point in the frame. I am really excited to start using this as well. Hopefully I can get some of these in on the Choose Your Adventure game.
