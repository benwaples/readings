## Understanding The problem domain
A simple problem domain makes it easier to focus on the technology. We have a hard time on solving the problem when we don't know what we are working on.

To understand the problem domain, you can make it easier by breaking it up into smaller tasks that make sense. Or you can try and understand as much as you can upfront before starting the coding, this will lead to less coding in the future of the project!
