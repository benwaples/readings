## HTML CH. 13
Covering the box concept and the CSS rules to control it's dimensions and how to style it. Block elements go on top of each other (vertical), and inline elements go left to right.

Switch statements are similar to a if else statement... just different syntax. I think I like the switch statement more. Not quite sure when the switch statement would be useful. We also looked at how to coerce data types and how to write statements to be truthy or falsy i.e `if (1 === 1) {}` would evaluate to true and the following code block would run. Do while loops run at least once before evaluating to true or false
