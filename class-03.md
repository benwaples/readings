Switch statements are similar to a if else statement... just different syntax. I think I like the switch statement more. Not quite sure when the switch statement would be useful. We also looked at how to coerce data types and how to write statements to be truthy or falsy i.e `if (1 === 1) {}` would evaluate to true and the following code block would run. Do while loops run at least once before evaluating to true or false
