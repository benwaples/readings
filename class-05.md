# # Reading 05 summary

## HTML CH.5
The `<img>` tag and its attributes like title and alt. Use jpeg file formats for photographs and gif/png for flat images. use ``<figure>` and `<figcaption>` when inserting an image by itself.

## HTML CH. 11
use the CSS `color` property to change text color, and use `background-color` to change the background color. You can declare the color in multiple ways. `opacity` is a new property in CSS3, use `hsla()` or `rgba()`for it. 

## JS CH. 12
I didn't realize there was such a difference between font-family and font-face. I don't fully understand when to use each. The table with each type of font and the licensing that goes along with it seems useful... but I would have to refer back to it if I had a problem with font.

Then the book covers all the different attributes that change the text appearance like `<font-weight>` `<text-transform>` and the pseudo-classes `:link` and `:visited`.

`^= starts with...`
`*= contains ... `
`$= ends with...`
